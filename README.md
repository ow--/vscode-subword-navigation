# Subword Navigation for Visual Studio Code
The missing code navigation feature causing developers all over the world such hardship and time loss by having to reach for that pesky mouse or selecting parts of words one single character at the time. No warranty.

## Usage
Open the new keyboard shortcuts interface and search for `subword`. The default bindings follow Sublime and Xcode, I think, but might overwrite something you like.

Note that `ctrl+left/right` might be reserved by Mission Control on macOS and would have to be turned off in the settings because we all know you'd rather fly through subwords in here with the correct shortcut than whatever Mission Control does.

## Available Commands
```
subwordNavigation.cursorSubwordLeft
subwordNavigation.cursorSubwordRight
subwordNavigation.cursorSubwordLeftSelect
subwordNavigation.cursorSubwordRightSelect
subwordNavigation.deleteSubwordLeft
subwordNavigation.deleteSubwordRight
subwordNavigation.expandSubwordSelection
```
